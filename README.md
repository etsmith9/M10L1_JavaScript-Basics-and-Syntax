Understanding Data Types in JavaScript
Objective: The objective of this assignment is to help students grasp the concept of data types in JavaScript and practice working with different types of data.

Problem Statement: Imagine you are developing a student management system for a school. Your task is to create a JavaScript program that declares variables to store information about students, such as their names, ages, grades, and attendance status.

Task 1: Declare variables to represent student information such as name, age, grade, and attendance status.

Task 2: Assign sample values to the student information variables.

// Task 2: Assign sample values
studentName = "Alice";
studentAge = 15;
studentGrade = 10;
isPresent = true;

Task 3: Display the student information using console.log() statements.

Expected Outcomes:

After completing Task 1, students should understand how to declare variables with different data types in JavaScript.
After completing Task 2, students should be able to assign values to variables of various data types.
After completing Task 3, students should be able to display variable values using console.log() statements.

Exploring JavaScript Operators
Objective: The objective of this assignment is to familiarize students with different types of operators in JavaScript and reinforce their understanding through practical exercises.

Problem Statement: You are tasked with developing a simple calculator program in JavaScript. Your program should be able to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Task 1: Declare variables to store two numeric values for performing arithmetic operations.

Task 2: Assign sample numeric values to the variables declared in Task 1.

Task 3: Perform arithmetic operations on your numeric values using various operators and display the results.

// Task 3: Perform arithmetic operations
console.log("Sum:", ....);
console.log("Difference:", ...);
console.log("Product:", ...);
console.log("Quotient:", ...);
Task 4: Explore assignment operators and update the values of variables.

// Task 4: Explore assignment operators
console.log("Updated num1:", ...);
console.log("Updated num2:", ...);
Task 5: Use comparison operators to compare the values of variables.

// Task 5: Use comparison operators
console.log("Is num1 equal to num2?", ...);
console.log("Is num1 greater than num2?", ...);
console.log("Is num1 not equal to num2?", ...);
Task 6: Apply logical operators to combine conditions and display the results.

// Task 6: Apply logical operators
let isPositive = ...;
let isEven = ...;
console.log("Are both numbers positive?", isPositive);
console.log("Is at least one number even?", isEven);
